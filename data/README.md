# Data (CSV)

This folder contains raw and processed CSV datasets used in this repository.

## Suggested structure
- `data/raw/`      : original exported CSV files (do not edit)
- `data/processed/`: cleaned/filtered/merged CSV files
- `data/results/`  : derived metrics, summaries, model outputs

## Notes
- Keep filenames consistent (no spaces; use `_`).
- Prefer adding a short description in each subfolder if needed.
